# Weather App

This is personal project built in plain HTML/CSS/Javascript
This project took me ages to complete and it was fun to work with.
I saw many people creating Weather Apps and I thought let's give it a shot.
But I wanted to make it convenint so they can search for a specific location's weather. So I implemented Mapbox places search API to get suggestions for the users. I wanted to use Google's MAP api but it said nope for me.

I have used API's from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/ "places search api") for search functionality and [OpenWeatherApi](https://openweathermap.org/ "Weather Api")
